A collection of utilities that work with sync and async iterables and iterators. Designed to replace your streams. Think some sort of combination of [`bluestream`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluestream) and [ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) but for a much more simple construct, async iterators. The goal is to make it dead easy to replace your stream based processes with async iterators, which in general should make your code smaller, faster and have less bugs.
